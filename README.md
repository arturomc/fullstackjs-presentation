*1 Still defining if we are to build a single application, or make groups between the trainees to explore different appliation cases, like a social network, a simple todo app with additional features, a filesystem job dispatcher, etc...

*2 I enlisted the help of a UI/UX asset and friend to be a consultant on the whole engaging UI UX part, but he is leaving the company soon, wo i guess i'll have to get someone else or do it myself, wanted to get different people from different areas to help with this for the reason i wrote below.

*3 I've enlisted a QA asset, Hector Spencer<h4yla@gmail.com>, to help me with this part, since i want to involve more people to rally even more areas to effectively engage on Fullstack development, it's not just about us, devs :D
